## Background information
Hong Kong is just a small dot on the map with only 1106 km<sup>2</sup> of area. However, she is the home of over 7.5 million of people. Having a huge population with very scarce land, citizens generally live in a crowded 200-400 ft<sup>2</sup> flat with their family. The only opportunity for them to enjoy large open space and breathe some fresh air is hiking.

## Initiative
There are a totol of 24 country parks and over 300 hiking trails with different levels in Hong Kong. Although people can search for trails information on the internet, it may not be convenient or favorable to go through all the websites just to find a particular trail. A centralized system is needed for this purpose. Thus a mobile app is a good start.
